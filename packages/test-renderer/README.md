# React Three Test Renderer ⚛️🔼🧪

`@react-three/test-renderer` is a React testing <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/codebase-overview.html#renderers">renderer</a> for threejs in node.

This repository is just a fork of https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber to develop new changes. Please check the upstream repo for documentation, releases, demos, and information about contributors and backers.

NB changes on the master branch itself are just to keep the fork separate from the official project and will never be upstreamed. New development that will be upstreamed takes place on branches.
